    "Here in this tutorial, we will create a very simple Python application that can be really useful in various business cases. It will be a simple application, because user can use it through the command prompt window. If you are not looking for fancy GUIs, you can construct your easy-peasy Python application right away and it can make your life a lot easier. You can give up preparing the same analysis over and over again, with different input parameters and save a great deal of your efforts in the long run.\n",

    "Suppose, I am interested in getting an idea of where €/$ exchange rate can move in some future and I would like to simulate it daily using Geometric Brownian Motion(GBM). At the end, I can calculate my risk due to currency movements. So, what I need to do is the following.\n",

    "1. Decide how far to go back in the past and get €/$ rate to calculate daily volatility to be used in GBM algorithm,\n",
    "2. Decide how far into the future our simulations should go,\n",

    "4. (optional) If I want to try different scenarios based on some daily volatility assumptions other than the historical one, I should be able to enter a daily volatility value manually\n",

    "2. Line graph of the simulated rates over all the scenarios as png\n",

So, all the operations take place on our Desktop or a user-created folder on Desktop, and the user can have access to the output files.\n",

    "Virtual environments are great for managing python versions, packages and dependencies. You can customize a specific environment for a specific project and you avoid any version & dependency problems. Using a single python environment to build many models may not be good practice since different projects may require different packages with different versions and updating a package may corrupt your other models causing things to get out of your control. Depending on this motivation, we may create model or project specific virtual environments and  therefore, we want our script to use default & installed packages from the virtual environment we want. In the later sections of this tutorial, we will explore in more detail how to change the python interpreter that our scripts use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before creating the virtual environment, you have to make sure that you have a working Python installation and it is in the Path. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and during the installation you can add python to the Path variable by checking the appropriate box on the installation screen when it appears (I believe it is the first screen). If you have a python installation, but it is not in the path, you can add it by:\n",

If you would like to continue using your existing editor, you need to make sure that your script uses the python in the virtual environment we just created as the interpreter. For instance, you can configure that in Spyder under \"Tools\" -> \"Preferences\" -> \"Python interpreter\", as below. This procedure can be a little tricky for Jupyter notebooks. That's why you can find a bonus section on how to add kernel to a Jupyter notebook at the end of this tutorial."

    "In order to simulate exchange rates, we use Geometric Brownian Motion(GBM). I am not going to get into theoretical background of what GBM is, in this tutorial. It is a whole another topic to be discussed(since it requires general knowledge of stochastic processes), but still I want to give a basic yet concrete mindset for you to realize what is going on. Below is a plug and play code to apply GBM. We just assign the appropriate values to the required parameters and we get a series of simulated forward exchange rates in list format (single series at a time). I took this code below from Jonathan Sullivan's article on \"Stochastic Calculus with Python: Simulating Stock Price Dynamics\". You can find the full document on https://jtsulliv.github.io/stock-movement/. It should be noted that this specific code block belongs to him and I don't claim any ownership (So, many thanks to him :)). We use this code in our script, but don't worry, I will tell what each piece of this code tries to do while clarifying the reasoning behind.  "

So, this function returns an array containing N many random shock values that are to be applied to each forward day during the simulation phase. As its name suggests, these random shock values provide the random path for our simulations. We create these random shocks using the standard normal variable z which has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. We multiply random standard normal variable z with square root of the time increment and we obtain the Brownian increments. Time increment in our problem is 1/N. Then, to get a path for the Brownian Motion, we need to calculate cumulative sum of the Brownian increments array. Below is a sample demonstration where we simulate exchange rates for 5 days. You can see how we can calculate the Brownian path W. I get the values in array z using numpy.random.normal(mean = 0, std = 1, size = 5).  "

S0 is the initial exchange rate that is passed into this function as an input parameter and in order to get a simulated exchange rate for a future day, we just multiply S0 with some expression containing the exponential function.

Geometric Brownian Motion is a stochastic process and it assumes that the exchange rate, for a time period(day), will drift with exp((mu - 0.5sigma^2)*dt) and there will be random shock to it, which is exp(sigma * dW).
