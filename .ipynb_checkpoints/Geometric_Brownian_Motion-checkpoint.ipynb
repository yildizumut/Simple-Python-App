    "In this article, we discuss how to construct a Geometric Brownian Motion(GBM) simulation using Python. While building the script, we also explore the intuition behind GBM model. I will not be getting into theorethical background of its derivation. It's beyond the scope of this article. I care more about giving a high level understanding of what GBM needs as parameters, what its components are and how it creates predictions. I will try to have a bottom-up approach and build up the logic of GBM starting from its components. The simulation model we develop here is a discrete time model. Therefore, all mathematics discussed here is discrete time analogy of Geometric Brownian Model for continuous stochastic processes. At the end of this article, we learn how to create simulations using GBM and how to write its Python code.  "
