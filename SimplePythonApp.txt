Here in this tutorial, we will create a very simple Python application that can be really useful in various business cases.
It will be a simple application, because user can use it through the command prompt window. If you are not looking for fancy GUIs,
you can construct your easy-peasy Python application right away and it can make your life a lot easier. You can give up preparing 
the same analysis over and over again, with different input parameters and save a great deal of your efforts in the long run.

I will rely on a single example throughout the tutorial and before diving deeper into it, I would like to talk about a business scenario
where we need a simple currency exchange rate analysis to get things going with our daily operations at work.

Suppose, I am interested in getting an idea of where €/$ exchange rate can move in some future and I would like to simulate it daily using
Geometric Brownian Motion(GBM). At the end, I can calculate my risk due to currency movements. So, what I need to do is the following.

1. Decide how far to go back in the past and get €/$ rate to calculate daily volatility to be used in GBM algorithm,
2. Decide how far into the future our simulations should go,
3. Decide how many different future scenarios we would like to have,
4. (optional) If I want to try different scenarios based on some daily volatility assumptions other than the historical one,
	I should be able to enter a daily volatility value manually
