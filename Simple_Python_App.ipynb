    "Here in this tutorial, we will create a very simple Python application that can be really useful in various business cases. It will be a simple application, because user can use it through the command prompt window. If you are not looking for fancy GUIs, you can construct your easy-peasy Python application right away and it can make your life a lot easier. You can give up preparing the same analysis over and over again, with different input parameters and save a great deal of your efforts in the long run.\n",

    "Suppose, I am interested in getting an idea of where €/$ exchange rate can move in some future and I would like to simulate it daily using Geometric Brownian Motion(GBM). At the end, I can calculate my risk due to currency movements. So, what I need to do is the following.\n",

    "1. Decide how far to go back in the past and get €/$ rate to calculate daily volatility to be used in GBM algorithm,\n",
    "2. Decide how far into the future our simulations should go,\n",

    "4. (optional) If I want to try different scenarios based on some daily volatility assumptions other than the historical one, I should be able to enter a daily volatility value manually\n",

    "2. Line graph of the simulated rates over all the scenarios as png\n",

So, all the operations take place on our Desktop or a user-created folder on Desktop, and the user can have access to the output files.\n",

    "Virtual environments are great for managing python versions, packages and dependencies. You can customize a specific environment for a specific project and you avoid any version & dependency problems. Using a single python environment to build many models may not be good practice since different projects may require different packages with different versions and updating a package may corrupt your other models causing things to get out of your control. Depending on this motivation, we may create model or project specific virtual environments and  therefore, we want our script to use default & installed packages from the virtual environment we want. In the later sections of this tutorial, we will explore in more detail how to change the python interpreter that our scripts use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before creating the virtual environment, you have to make sure that you have a working Python installation and it is in the Path. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and during the installation you can add python to the Path variable by checking the appropriate box on the installation screen when it appears (I believe it is the first screen). If you have a python installation, but it is not in the path, you can add it by:\n",

If you would like to continue using your existing editor, you need to make sure that your script uses the python in the virtual environment we just created as the interpreter. For instance, you can configure that in Spyder under \"Tools\" -> \"Preferences\" -> \"Python interpreter\", as below. This procedure can be a little tricky for Jupyter notebooks. That's why you can find a bonus section on how to add kernel to a Jupyter notebook at the end of this tutorial."
